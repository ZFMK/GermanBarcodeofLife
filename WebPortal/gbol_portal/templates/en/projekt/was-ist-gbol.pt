					The GBOL project aims at capturing the genetic diversity of animals, fungi and plants in Germany. The genetic inventory
					of these organisms is based on their DNA barcodes (=genetic fingerprint). As a science nation, Germany has taken a leading role in an international consortium of natural history museums, zoos, herbaria,
					<a title="Learn more about our international partners." href="/links#kooperationspartner">research organizations and government institutions</a>
					to jointly establish the "DNA barcode library of life" (
					<a target="_blank" href="/download?fileName=iBOL_FactSheet_German.pdf">pdf</a>).
					Currently there are about 4.6 million
					<a title="Erfahren Sie mehr &uuml;ber DNA Barcoding." href="/dna-barcoding/was-ist-dna-barcoding">DNA Barcodes</a> belonging to
					ca. 250,000 described species of plants, animals and fungi recorded in the international
					<a class="ext" href="http://v4.boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeIndexNumber_Home" target="_blank"> BOLD database</a>
					(January 2016). The DNA barcodes of all animals
					<a class="ext" href="http://v4.boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BarcodeIndexNumber_Home" target="_blank">on BOLD</a>
					constitute about 440,000 different species hypotheses, termed
					<a class="ext" href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066213" target="_blank">BINs (barcode index number)</a>.
					BINs are molecular entities, which are based on clustering DNA barcodes by similarity
					and represent putative species until a taxonomic revision has revealed their species membership. The systematic assessment
					and grouping of BINs allows to categorize and monitor their occurrence in time and space, even if they belong to yet undescribed species.

				<p>
					GBOL is a national network of various natural history museums and other
					<a title="Learn more about GBOL institutions." href="/team/gbol-institute">biodiversity research institutions</a>
					in Germany. The GBOL partners provide their professional taxonomic expertise and existing infrastructure (collections / biobanks,
					databases, bioinformatics platforms and laboratories) to comprehensively collect, catalog, describe, and sequence the animal,
					plant and fungi species in Germany. While the focus in GBOL during the first phase (2012-2015) was laid on the creation of a
					reference database, we will now also develop different applications of DNA barcoding in the second project
					phase (2016-2018). Sequence and metadata generated in GBOL will be integrated in the global barcode reference database "
					<a title="Learn more about our international partners." href="/links">BOLD</a>
					".
				</p>
				<p>
					The construction of a genetic national library of biodiversity consists of two steps: First, specialized experts (taxonomists)
					identify species based on their morphological characters. The taxonomists have an extensive knowledge of the morphology,
					ecology, reproductive mode and life cycle of certain taxa, which proves extremely valuable for species determination.
					In a second step, the DNA barcode will be decoded using modern DNA sequencing methods. The DNA barcode together with
					the species profile will be made available in publicly accessible DNA barcode reference database, such as
					<a class="ext" href="http://v4.boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BINSearch?searchtype=records" target="_blank">BOLD</a>,
					<a class="ext" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/" target="_blank">NCBI GenBank</a> or
					<a class="ext" href="http://www.algaterra.org/default.htm" target="_blank">AlgaTerra</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The professional GBOL taxonomists depend on the active support and cooperation of
					<a title="Learn more about the registration methods for experts." href="/mitmachen/teilnahmeinfos">experienced citizen scientists and non-professional taxonomists from all over Germany</a>
					 to meet this GBOL task.
