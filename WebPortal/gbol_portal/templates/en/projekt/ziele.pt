					The GBOL consortium is working with a variety of different organisms from different geographic regions
					in Germany. In the second project phase (2016-2018) also diatoms and other fungal groups are now included
					that were previously represented by only a few rust fungi. Yet, all project partners have common,
					general interests and goals:
				</p>
					<ol style="padding-left: 0px;">
						<li class="justify">Building a DNA barcode library of organisms occurring in Germany with the corresponding voucher and DNA collections. </li>
						<li class="justify">Collaboration of various taxonomists in a country-wide inventory effort.</li>
						<li class="justify">Development of DNA barcode applications with substantial scientific, forensic, epidemiological and economic benefits.</li>
					</ol>

					Towards the end of the first phase of GBOL (2015) the DNA barcode system has undergone various practical tests in cooperation with potential users of DNA barcoding. A general summary can be found in our
					<a class="ext" href="https://www.zfmk.de/dateien/atoms/files/verbundbericht_gbol_f2014.pdf" target="_blank">interim report for 2014</a>.
					Among other things, the following test applications were performed:
					<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 0px;" start="1">
						<li class="justify">In collaboration with a fisheries biologist and an environmental agency the macrofauna of the Sieg River near Bonn was examined by DNA barcoding and various aspects of this methodology compared to the conventional methods.</li>
						<li class="justify">DNA meta-barcoding of environmental samples from the Eifel National Park (e.g. malaise traps, soil samples) using next generation sequencing (NGS).</li>
						<li class="justify">Detection and determination of pest species in forestry in cooperation with the Bavarian Forest National Park.</li>
						<li class="justify">In farm, a parasite monitoring should be tested with farm livestock based on DNA barcoding.</li>
						<li class="justify">A DNA barcode reference library of a typical spring fauna, which is highly susceptible to climate change in the Berchtesgaden National Park was established.</li>
					</ol>
					In the following, second GBOL funding period (2016-2018) further field- and application studies in the context of forestry, agriculture, water quality assessment and forensics are conducted. Details on these can be
